# fitmegut
Clothing donation &amp; exchange - community website that allows members to give new life to their unwanted clothes, reducing waste and helping those in need.

## “Nothing is old, it's all about how you look at things”

Nowadays, there are many alternatives for buying clothes at competitive prices, from low-cost
online shops to high street stores with attractive promotions. So many people buy clothes for
one-off occasions and then leave them in storage for years or decades, sometimes in damp
basements, degrading them to the point where their only destination is the bin.
In order to avoid so much waste and to save the planet, fitMegut is a website that aims to put
clothes into circulation, saving money and helping those in need. Circulation can be:
1. By donating to charities or people displaced by war (Ukraine).
2. It can be exchanged between registered or anonymous members. The interested parties
agree on the form and/or place of the exchange and carry it out in person or by post, the
costs being borne by the interested parties.
